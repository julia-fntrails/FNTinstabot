John Ainsworth Dunn (1831-1919), a successful chair manufacturer in Gardner, began purchasing the land in this area in 1896, with the intent of establishing a park. He gave the property to the City of Gardner in his will. \\n\\nThe park is now known for its swimming and fishing in the warmer months and hiking year-round! Check the link in our bio for a trail map and remember when visiting any state park or property be sure to wear a face-covering and maintain good social distancing from others! #centenial #gardnerma #dunnpond #statepark #getoutdoors'\n",
